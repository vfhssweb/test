        <div class="accordion-body text-center">Educational in Emergency is not only right but in the situations of emergencies it is a fundamental necessity. It provides physical, social and cognitive protection 
          which can be both lifesaving and life sustaining. Education sustains life by offering individuals particularly children and adolescents safe space for living as well as 
          the ability to identify and provide support for affected people. The above is a picture of school children being taught under a tree; this is obviously not conducive 
          for effective teaching and learning. The village lacks classrooms, either permanent or temporary, to accommodate the young children who are definitely very 
          eager to learn. During the rainy season studies cannot be conducted and children are forced to remain at home. What is worse, a lot of parents have not 
          embraced the idea of education, so there are a lot of children who have reached school going age but have not yet been enrolled into any kind of school. Most 
          communities in South Sudan have had adverse effects of ethnic strife and an absolute distraction of all amenities through the current and previous insurgency; 
          these have deprived the majority of the children of their right to Education. 
          Together with the building of schools, training of teachers, Vision for Humanity South Sudan is also involved in the water and sanitation part of this. It is important 
          to raise class attendance as much as possible by reducing infection rates caused by water borne diseases and poor hygiene. So hygiene awareness and the 
          construction of latrines are part of Vision for Humanity South Sudan education program.

          VISION FOR HUMANITY SOUTH SUDAN WILL IMPROVE ON THE FOLLOWING AREA:
          Improving access to basic education
           Vision for Humanity South Sudan improves access to education by taking part in the extensive establishment of infrastructure including building temporary 
          schools and latrines; and Provide furniture for the temporary schools and distribute didactical materials. The furniture’s distributed to the schools include 
          blackboards, mats for sitting on, school bells, note books and pens for teachers and the deductible materials which are given to the most vulnerable 
          children, they include pens, note books and basic books. Other activities include: Recruitment of teachers and educators 
           A careful consideration is given to gender aspect whilst building or supplied equipment to the schools. It’s imperative to understand the dynamics of culture 
          and religion in south Sudan. Girls reaching puberty time have the most difficult time during schooling. This specific group has difficult attending schools if 
          there are no latrines of access to water. Most it’s important for the school to get a female teacher in a country dominated by males. 
           Girl-child is given special attention at the school we support. Increased basic rights to access to latrine for instance is a major step in a country were 
          otherwise people go the bushes to defecate. Our strategy has ensured an increase in attendance of girl-child. Also their attendances decrease the chances 
          of them going to collecting firewood, or rearing cattle where most rape cases take place. 
           Build and Rehabilitate Temporary as well as permanent primary schools in the target areas.
           Increase access to primary education as well as curriculum improvement.
           Increase attendances in school by increasing Wash qualities as well as nutrition qualities.
           Hygiene and Sanitation campaigns in the schools.
           Increase quality of hygiene and sanitation at schools by building latrines and providing water.
           Create self-sufficient programs to improve on quality education - primary, secondary and tertiary institutions - managed by Vision for Humanity South 
          Sudan.
           Invest in relevant vocational training skills. 
           Provide scholarships and support school talent management – for students in fields such as innovation, arts and culture
           Create an endowment portfolio for the education sector to increase income generating activities for sustainability.
           Mobilize resources from private sector, international NGOs and diaspora/individual donors.
           Enhance the social welfare program.

          Endless and aimless fights in South Sudan have caused massive exodus of innocent people mainly women and children to the outskirts of South Sudan seeking for 
          a more secure environment outside the country and other states. These people mostly end up in IDP camps. The majority of the fleeing women and children 
          tend to head to POC and Camps where they face more harsh lives and are exposed to a number of violations from the host communities as well as militias and 
          gunmen. Women and children that end up living in the IDP camps occasionally face a number of violations such as Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV), 
          deprivation of food or rights to obtain humanitarian aid, children are exposed to child labour and are deprived from rights to go to school, the youth also are 
          another vulnerable group that are affected by the general crisis.

        <div class="accordion-body text-center">Rape, FGM, Forced/Early Marriage, Domestic Violence, Sexual Exploitation and Attempt rape
          a) SGBV Victims
          Who is likely to be a victim varies across the age. In south Sudan and of course across the country women in different ages become victims to SGBV. There are 
          young and old victims but the majority of victims are from 13 years, sometimes even younger, to 45 years old. This is the most vulnerable age group that can be 
          victims of SGBV. 
          b) Women who are likely to fall victims of SGBV:
          Young girls that work as maids and live with host communities are extremely likely to be raped. And the sad thing about these women (girls) is that it’s difficult 
          to come to know that they are victims. These young girls can suffer in silence for a long time or endanger themselves by running away from the host communities 
          and their families. Girls/Women who collect fire woods from the bush and sell in markets or just use it for fire wood at home for cooking purposes: Some 
          girls/women work for their families and sell fire wood in the market. They go out to the bush to collect fire wood- that is when they fall victims of SGBV 
          Girls/Women who live in the IDP Camps: A group which is extremely vulnerable are the IDP’s. We have come to know that in South Sudan, sometimes men 
          will come the IDP camps in search of a woman to seduce and this mentality mostly leads to rape incidents, especially when women go out to relieve themselves 
          in the near woods. 
          Revenge Rape: there are times where revenge rape takes place and it affects women who are not necessarily minority but the incident affects them the same 
          way. Besides the series of rapes women suffer in the country there are also some other SGBV incidents such as Domestic Violence that affects not only women 
          who are married but also the young girls who work as maids within the host communities. 
          FGM practices are also another SGBV violation to young girls in the country. This myth has violated and continuous to violate a numerous young girls in the 
          country. 
          c) Coping Mechanism.
          There is a numerous ways victims cope with the situation and the problems. There are three major problems faced by the victims when they are raped.
          a) The physical injuries that has been inflicted upon the victim. 
          b) The fear of stigmatization- not only the victim has this fear, but the family of the victim as well and
          c) The psychosocial problem the victim faces
           Bible: When one is inflicted with horrible physical and psychosocial damage, families tend to immediately resort to Bible- they keep the victim at home, call 
          pastor to pray for the victim on a weekly basis and hope for the best that the condition of the victim gets better. 
           Time healing: Some families keep the victim at home and don’t take them to hospital or/and don’t take any further actions in terms of healing or helping 
          the victim heal. These families expect time to heal and resolve the problems
           Marriage: There are families that resort to arranged marriage after the girl/women is being victimized. They either marry the girl out to a cousin who 
          volunteers or if the family is lucky they will find the perpetrator and ask him to marry the girl he’s raped. This is popular coping mechanism because even 
          elders will recommend this after the rape incident
           Move away from the area: victims and their families move away from the area the incident took place in fear of stigmatization
           Clan Members help financially: In some rare occasion clan members come together and help the victimized girl/woman financially so that family can give 
          the victim proper care
           NGO help: Some Local NGO’s such as Vision for Humanity South Sudan do provide some form of limited help to SGBV victims especially when the case 
          is fresh. Vision For Humanity South Sudan does advocate for SGBV victims but to persecute perpetrators is a bit difficult in all over the country as most of 
          perpetrators are extremely armed or/and are from strong clans</div>

        <div class="accordion-body text-center">Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) strives to improve the living conditions during displacement, ensure assistance and protection of IDPs in 
          displacement sites, as well as to seek durable solutions to end temporary displacement, with an organized closure and phase out of displacement sites.
          Appropriate coordination and management of camps and collective accommodation is primarily the responsibility of national authorities. In practice, States 
          often welcome humanitarian actors who support them to ensure protection and assistance to displaced populations. CCCM exists to uphold the basic human 
          right to life with dignity.
          Camp Coordination involves overseeing the humanitarian assistance in or between several camps or settlements, camp management takes place at camp level. 
          Both functions can be performed by authorities and humanitarian actors, although in the latter case national authorities must acknowledge their overall 
          responsibility. CCCM does not advocate for settlements, but when there are no other shelter solutions camps can be used as a last resort. Planning for closure 
          and more lasting solutions start at the beginning of opening a site working closely with national authorities, partners providing assistance, and the displaced 
          population. Throughout discussions with the affected communities, key considerations for short and long-term solutions are identified and shared with other 
          stakeholders.

          Public health in South Sudan has been impacted directly (civil unrest and violence) and indirectly (diseases and/or malnutrition) from both man-made and natural 
          disasters, most susceptible to the constant threat of concurrent droughts, food insecurity and civil unrest have been the most vulnerable in society, namely 
          women, children, old people and people living in poverty. 
          For over two and half years Vision For Humanity south Sudan has worked to improve the health of vulnerable populations in the country through the 
          establishment of local health facilities, providing sustainable health services, increasing access to basic health amongst the poor and saving lives through provision 
          of emergency medical services.
